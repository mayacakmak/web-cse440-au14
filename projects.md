# Projects

## Winter 2015 Projects

Here are the selected project topics based on the submitted proposals. Please read the anonymized sample proposals carefully and then submit your project preferences by Jan 12, 2:30pm [here](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/946041/quizzes/816121). Note that the proposals provide a rough scope of the project topic and problem space; any solution discussed in the posted proposals should be ignored. The teaching staff will have additional conditions and suggestions for each project. Try to prioritize projects you are excited about rather than ones you think would be easy; we will make sure all projects are equally difficult/easy :-)
