# Assignment 2: Getting the Right Design

Even for a well-understood, well-motivated problem, choosing a design to invest time into is a difficult and laborious process. 
This group assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, tackles the problem of selecting the right design through 
__contextual inquiry__, __task development__, __generating multiple potential designs__, and finally __selecting a design__ to pursue.

---

## Milestones

This is a group assignment, consisting of several milestones.
It is worth __20%__ of your overall course grade:

- __5%__ for the milestones 
  - __0.5%__ for [Assignment 2a: Project Ideation](#assignment2a)

## Project Description

In this assignment, you will brainstorm a large set of possible tasks and design ideas for your project. 
You will then use contextual inquiry to learn more about your problem and the current practices of people who might use your design. 
You will draw upon the ideas developed in your brainstorming and the observations made in your contextual inquiry
to help develop a set of potential tasks your design might support. 
You will next sketch how a set of initial designs might support those tasks.
You will choose a design to pursue in the remainder of the course and storyboard the details of your design in
the context of important tasks
Finally, you will present your design process in a report and presentation.

More specifically, you will do the following:

1. Generate ideas for potential problems, tasks, features, and interactions using a group ideation exercise.

   ([Assignment 2a](#project_ideation))
    
2. Use the contextual inquiry method in observing and interviewing at least __three__ people who might use your design.

3. Develop __six__ tasks that might be performed with your design. 

   Select these to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving and to provide coverage of the designs 
   you will explore. Create these based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks as well as your vision for 
   new tasks enabled by potential designs. Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to accomplish it. 
   
   As you progress through your project, you can and should consider revising your tasks. 
   Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures or according to feedback you receive.
   The tasks you report in this assignment therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.

4. Brainstorm and sketch __three__ very different initial designs for your interface. 
   Each design should support __four__ of your tasks.
   
   Do not illustrate the entire design, but instead sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality. 
   These should be rough sketches on paper (i.e., not digital mockups), including illustrations of their relations 
   (e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships).    
   
   The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design.
   They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem.

5. From your sketches, select __one__ design to pursue for the remainder of the quarter and __two__ tasks that emphasize
   critical functionality of your design. These tasks should be non-trivial, critical to solving your problem, and should 
   emphasize long-lived or repeated activities. In contrast, a one-time login screen for a social networking application 
   is not worth being the focus of your project, does not define your project functionality, and is not interesting.

   Storyboard your chosen design for your chosen tasks, illustrating how the tasks are accomplished in your design.
    
6. Summarize your design process in a report and presentation.

## Deliverable 2a: Project Ideation -- Due: Tuesday in class, Jan 13

Generate 64 different ideas related to your project, including:

- specific problems and needs that a person might have in the context of your larger problem
- tasks: what a person might accomplish in this context
- features: a capability a design might have
- interactions: how a feature might work

We will provide large sheets of paper and post-its.
Write or sketch each idea on a separate post-it and stick it on your sheet of paper.
Each idea should be a quick doodle with a caption or a short sentence or phrase. 
A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.
Use color, space, and arrows (on your sheet of paper) to organize your ideas as you go.

The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some particular possibility. 
Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the quality of any one idea.
You may include ideas from existing products. No two ideas should be alike.
When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.

### Submission

In class, one of the course staff will sign off on what you completed.

You will be able to take your paper with you, and you should continue brainstorming throughout your project.

### Grading

This milestone is worth 0.5% of your total grade and will be graded based on a good-faith attempt to generate ideas during the ideation brainstorming exercise.

## 2b: Contextual Inquiry Plan -- Due: Jan 16, 4:00am

In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design and other stakeholders for your design. 
Describe the particular contextual inquiry participants you plan to pursue, 
including some details of their background and the environment where you will observe their current practices. 
Give enough details to convince us that you can actually find and interview your target participants in the next week. 

For example, your target participants should not be "doctors" but instead a specific group of doctors 
(e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt Clinic). 
If gaining access to the target participants is non-trivial (e.g., as with busy doctors), 
describe the steps you have taken to gain access and your plans to recover if you are unable to gain access. 
Indicate when you will be conducting your three inquiries, being as specific as possible.

In another paragraph, describe how you will interact with your participants and your role as the "apprentice".
 
- Will you be observing their current behaviors?
- Will you be interviewing them about recent behaviors?
 
Please be as specific as possible, providing potential examples of your observation focus or interview questions.

### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format. Submit via Canvas here:

{% if page.link_assignment2b != nil %}<{{ page.link_assignment2b }}>{% else %}`Canvas link to be added`{% endif %}

In section, be prepared to discuss the plan with other teams and the course staff.

### Grading

This milestone is worth 0.5% of your total grade and will be graded based on:

1. __People and Plan__: (60%)
2. __Feasibility__: (20%)
3. __Specificity__: (20%)

## 2c: Contextual Inquiry Check-In -- Due: Jan 20, 4:00am

Complete at least one contextual inquiry prior to this check-in. 
You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design, but also about how to conduct a contextual inquiry.

Describe your first inquiry: 

- Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.
- What did you learn? 
- What tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover? 
- Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?

Discuss what remains to be pursued after your first inquiry. We fully expect changes will be necessary, as inquiries 
can be difficult to get right and often important topics are left unresolved. 

- What are your plans for the remaining inquiries? 
- How do you plan to change your protocol based on what you learned in your first inquiry?

###Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format. Submit via Canvas here:

{% if page.link_assignment2c != nil %}<{{ page.link_assignment2c }}>{% else %}`Canvas link to be added`{% endif %}

In the class, be prepared to discuss your contextual inquiry with other teams and the course staff.

### Grading

This milestone is worth 0.5% of your total grade and will be graded based on:

1. __Information from First Participant__: (60%)
2. __Plan for Remaining Participants__: (40%)
