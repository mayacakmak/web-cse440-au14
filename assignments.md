## Submission

You will submit your assignments through [Canvas](http://canvas.uw.edu).
Many assignments are due "the night before class".
On Canvas this corresponds to 4:00am.

In order to be prepared to give you feedback, the course staff must have your submission in the morning.
Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore unacceptable, risking zero credit.

Submissions should be in PDF format (i.e., not plain text, not Word). 
The PDF should be 'printable', containing everything we need to review and grade the assignment (e.g., your name).
The course staff has a large number of submissions to manage, so format and completeness issues are problematic.
